Interrogated and tortured by Major Schiffer, head of the Gestapo, their silence saved other women and men involved in the resistance within the clandestine committee assisting deportees from the Lager at Via Resia. After the interrogations, they were imprisoned in the Bolzano Lager for just over a month. On February 1, 1945, along with 528 other deportees, they departed from the Via Pacinotti platform, arriving at the Mauthausen Lager on February 4. After quarantine and registration at Mauthausen, they were transferred to Gusen. Due to the terrible living and working conditions in the camps, none of them returned.",
